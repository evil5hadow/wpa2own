## About

The goal of this project is to automate the process of capturing packets on a WPA2 protected wireless network, and crack their PSK (pre-shared keys). We know that WPA3 is coming, but most didn't know that WPA2 was as susceptible to being broken as it is with this recently released [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net) method.

### History

* on August 4, 2018 there was an announcement on the Hashcat forum of a [New attack on WPA/WPA2 using PMKID](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) The tweet linking to it:
<div align="center"><img src="img/tweet.png" alt="The announcement tweet"></div>

* using that info, and other ideas fleshed out from [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/how-to-hack-wifi-password.html) how-to post, the genesis for this project started
* on August 8, 2018 in Las Vegas, the day before [DEF CON](https://defcon.org) 26, I started building this using [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) Rolling release (4.17.0-kali1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.17.8-1kali1 (2018-07-24) x86_64 GNU/Linux) for development and testing
* now that I'm working on it more, I see a many more posts about this method. The original how-to, [How to Hack WiFi Password Easily Using New Attack On WPA/WPA2](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/how-to-hack-wifi-password.html), and others I'm finding, [A New Method Discovered to Crack WPA/WPA2 PSK Enabled WiFi Network Passwords](https://gbhackers.com/crack-wifi-network-passwords/), [New attack on WPA/WPA2 using PMKID](https://medium.com/@adam.toscher/new-attack-on-wpa-wpa2-using-pmkid-96c3119f7f99)

## Requirements

### Hardware

- a 64 bit Linux system with a network card that supports montior mode - see [Gotchas](#gotchas)
- a 64 bit Linux system with a GPU (graphics processing unit) for running Hashcat against the pcap - again, see [Gotchas](#gotchas). In this example we're assuming this is a separate machine, but in the case that you have both on one system, we could rework things to account for that.

### System utilities

- bash
- curl
- git
- make
- rsync
- sudo 

### Packages needed to build hcxtools 
  
- libopenssl and openssl-dev installed
- librt and librt-dev installed (should be installed by default)
- zlib and zlib-dev installed (for gzip compressed cap/pcap/pcapng files)
- libcurl and curl-dev installed (used by whoismac and wlancap2wpasec)
- libpthread and pthread-dev installed (used by hcxhashcattool)
       
EXAMPLE: to install all software requirements in Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, or Kali Linux: 

```sudo apt-get -y install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev libgmp3-dev```

__TODO: include package list for other Linux distros. LMK if you figure any out!__

### Tools that the script will download and build

- hcxdumptool (v4.2.0+)
- hcxtools (v4.2.0+)
- hashcat (v4.2.0+)

## Gotchas

1) You need a networking card that supports monitor mode under Linux, from online posts I've seen the following NICs listed:

```
Supported adapters (strict)

USB ID 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp. MT7601U Wireless Adapter
USB ID 148f:3070 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT2870/RT3070 Wireless Adapter
USB ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter
USB ID 0bda:8187 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8187 Wireless Adapter
USB ID 0bda:8189 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8187B Wireless 802.11g 54Mbps Network Adapter
```

For development and testing, I used the [Ralink RT5370](https://www.amazon.com/Ralink-RT5370-Raspberry-adapter-function/dp/B019XUDHFC) USB wireless plugged into my Mac Book Air (6,1) laptop. The output from `lusb` is:

```
$ lsusb | grep Ralink
Bus 001 Device 039: ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter
```

2) The old `hashcat-legacy` uses the CPU to try and crack hashes, but that code is over 3 years old, and is going to be far too slow to crack what we're capturing here. I might provide it as an option, but it's really more of a POC that you could used in canned environments with very simple passwords. To really get the ball rolling you can should use `hashcat` with the OpenCL headers (we pull those down as part of the build), and that requires a system with a compatible GPU.

__TODO: give examples of how this works, with specfic drivers__

## Usage

After resolving the requirements and understanding the gotchas:

```
./wpa2own
```

__NOTICE (8/14/2018) currently, once the scan is complete, your output file is saved in the `out/` dir, ready to run against `hashcat` on a system with GPU processors. I'm working to get this bit automated so it will `scp` the file to a GPU enabled rig, run it there and give you the results. This is a WIP, working to have complete by next week!__
